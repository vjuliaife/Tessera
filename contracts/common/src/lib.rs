//! Shared helpers for the Tessera RWA contract suite: emergency-pause state
//! and the WASM code-upgrade pattern (issue #11).
//!
//! This crate deliberately does *not* define a shared `Error` enum. Each
//! contract (registry, compliance, dividend, asset-token) keeps its own
//! error type and numbering — a new `Paused` variant is appended after that
//! specific contract's highest existing error code, rather than renumbering
//! anything or forcing all four contracts onto one shared enum. This crate
//! only factors out the mechanical, identical-everywhere bits: the storage
//! key for the pause flag, and the host call for a code upgrade.
